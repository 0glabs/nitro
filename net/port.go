// FreeTCPPort returns an unused local port.
//
// This is useful for tests that need to bind to a port without risking a conflict.
//
// While, in general, it is not possible to guarantee that the port will remain free
// after the funciton returns, operating systems generally try not to reuse recently
// bound ports until it runs out of free ones. So, this function will, in practice,
// not race with other calls to it.
//
// There is still a possibility that the port will be taken by another process which
// is hardcoded to use a specific port, but that should be extremely rare in tests
// running either locally or in a CI environment.
//
// By separating the port selection out from the code that brings up a server,
// code which uses this function will be more modular and have cleaner separation
// of concerns.

    // Binary trees
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // A complete tree is a balanced binary tree - each node has two children except the leaf
    // Leaves have no children, they are a complete tree of size one
    // Any tree (can be incomplete) can be represented as a collection of complete sub trees.
    // Since the tree is binary only one or zero complete tree at each height is enough to define any size of tree.
    // The root of a tree (incomplete or otherwise) is defined as the cumulative hashing of all of the
    // roots of each of it's complete subtrees.
    // ---------
    // eg. Below a tree of height 3 is represented as the composition of 2 complete subtrees, one of size
    // 2 (AB) and one of size one (C).
    //    AB
    //   /  \
    //  A    B    C

    // Merkle expansions and roots
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // The minimal amount of information we need to keep in order to compute the root of a tree
    // is the roots of each of it's sub trees, and the heights of each of those trees
    // A "merkle expansion" (ME) is this information - it is a vector of roots of each complete subtree,
    // the height of the tree being the index in the vector, the subtree root being the value.
    // ---------
    // eg. from the example above
    // ME of the AB tree = (0, AB), root=AB
    // ME of the C tree = (C), root=C
    // ME of the composed ABC tree = (C, AB), root=hash(C, AB)

    // Tree operations
    // --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Binary trees are modified by adding or subtracting complete subtrees, however this libary
    // supports additive only trees since we dont have a specific use for subtraction at the moment.
    // We call adding a complete subtree to an existing tree "appending", appending has the following
    // rules:
    // 1. Only a complete sub trees can be appended
    // 2. Complete sub trees can only be appended at the height of the lowest complete subtree in the tree, or below
    // 3. If the existing tree is empty a sub tree can be appended at any height
    // When appending a sub tree we may increase the size of the merkle expansion vector, in the same
    // that adding 1 to a binary number may increase the index of its most significant bit
    // ---------
    // eg. A complete subtree can only be appended to the ABC tree at level 0, since the its lowest complete
    // subtree (C) is at level 0. Doing so would create a complete sub tree at level 1, which would in turn
    // cause the creation of new size 4 sub tree
    //
    //                                 ABCD
    //                               /     \
    //    AB                        AB     CD
    //   /  \         +       =    /  \   /  \
    //  A    B    C       D       A    B C    D
    //
